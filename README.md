[Omakub](https://omakub.org/) is the original inspiration for Altadaim.

Altadaim is designed for simplicity.

## How to install it

Start with a fresh Ubuntu install
(we recommend any Ubuntu 24.04 LTS,
[Pop!_OS' 22.04](https://system76.com/pop/download/) also works).

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadaim/main/install_altadaim.sh && sudo bash install_altadaim.sh
```

Note: When you encounter input boxes and don't know what to select,
just stick with the already selected option.
