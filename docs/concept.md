# Altadim is an AI dev setup for your Linux laptop

Altadim is a developer steup for AI technologists that give you a one command ready environmet to
start developing your work with minimum to zero conflicts.
Usually, setting up your computer takes time and requires customisation.
In contrast, we want to make it easy to install most of what you need with one command.
If there are customisations that you require,
we provide an easy-to-understand way to include these customisations.
Because time spent configuring is not time spent creating, we aim
 to provide consistency across machines and team members.
