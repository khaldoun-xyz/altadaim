# Altadim is an AI dev setup for your Linux laptop

Start working on AI development work on day 1.
Usually, setting up your computer takes time and requires customisation.
In contrast, we want to make it easy to install most of what you need with one command.
If there are customisations that you require,
we provide an easy-to-understand way to include these customisations.

## What you need

- a fresh pop_os install
- an internet connection

## What you get

- a great basic lazyvim setup for AI development in Python
- a great basic vscode setup for AI development in Python
- dev tools like Alacritty, Zellij, Docker, Tmux, Sqlite, psql,
  Aider, screenshot tools (e.g. flameshot)

## How to learn more?

We documented how to use your new setup at <https://books.khaldoun.xyz/2/altadim>.
If you have suggestions how to improve Altadim
or which features to add, open an issue.
